                    <h3>Bella</h3>
                    <p>Bella and her four siblings were born in foster care. 
                    They got great care from both their cat mama and foster 
                    mom. Bella is described as the most independent. 
                    Although she loves playing and snuggling with her siblings, 
                    she can also be happy entertaining herself or off on her own for a snooze.
                    She can be a little spooked by loud noises and strangers. 
                    But she's quickly over it and ready to soak in all the attention she can get.
                    Little Bella is hoping to find her forever family soon!</p>

                    <h3>Leo</h3>
                    <p>Leo is a beautiful boy with a pretty grey tabby coat. He has a fluffy tail 
                   and cool tufts of hair coming from his ears. He was found outside and has been 
                   getting used to his new surroundings here at the shelter. After spending some 
                   time checking everything out, he decided that we're not so bad and let us pet 
                   him. As long as we don't pull any fast moves, he's happy to get some attention. 
                   He is now in our cageless cat room with lots of other cats. He has chosen the 
                   highest shelf to hang out on for now. This way he can keep his eye on everything 
                   that goes on and make sure he feels comfortable before venturing down. Leo will 
                   need a little extra time in order to feel confident in his new home. He'll be 
                   grateful to be given a chance!</p>

                    <h3>Milo</h3>
                    <p> Milo had been hanging around outside for a while. Someone discovered that 
                    he's a very nice boy and thought he'd be happier safe inside. He has 
                    definitely learned to appreciate the good life! Milo loves having his chubby 
                    cheeks rubbed and being told how handsome he is. He is shy in new settings 
                    and when first meeting people. But give him a few minutes and he's ready to 
                    make friends. He gets along fine with other cats. Milo will be happiest in 
                    a calm home where he can feel confident enough to let his personality shine!</p>

                    <h3>Charlie</h3>
                    <p>This little sweetheart has a cute little "Charlie Chaplin" mustache! 
                    (young people - look it up!) He is a typical kitten with lots of energy and personality. 
                    He's made friends with another kitten here and they love to hang out and play together.
                    They even snuggle up together for nap time! Charlie is all set to head off to his forever home
                    and meet his new best friend! You can see Charlie at our Pet Adoption center.

                    <h3>Kitty</h3>
                    <p>Kitty is a cute little kitten. She came to us after losing 
                    her home due to housing issues. In her foster home Kitty learned all sorts of things, like 
                    how to play and chase after her siblings. Her favorite activity is cuddling up with someone 
                    for a nice snuggle. She will sit happily on a lap and watch her siblings get crazy while she 
                    soaks in the love! This special girl is waiting to meet her forever family! You can see Kitty
                    at our Pet Adoption Center. In order to meet with her please fill out an application first.</p>

                <p>This is a fake website. No one is going to send you a cat 
                    through the mail... But I hope the website looks presentable
                    and offical. Thank you again. - ogmachii
